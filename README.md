# Swap-Consecutive-Index-Pairs

I'm falling back into K-pop - it's inevitable when you code so much I guess ðŸ˜Œ

Only problem is I only listen to music from like 2016-2018 

***Question: Given a list of integers nums, swap each consecutive even indexes with each other, and swap each consecutive odd indexes with each other.***

Anywho this question - I frickin knew I'd hit tiMe LiMiT eXcEedEd with the code I produced but it still works and tbh I'm not mad at it. I've also realised that it's easier for me to write the steps on paper before I start coding the actual thing.

So I did see another method but I'm not able to properly understand it. Will probs have to stare at it for 4 hours.
